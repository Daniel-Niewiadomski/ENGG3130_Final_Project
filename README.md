# ENGG3130_Final_Project
A Case Study in Complex Systems Modelling

Possible Ideas:
* train a neural networks to predict value of hypebeast shoes (goat app)
* create a model using supervised machine learning to predict whether a soccer player is injured or going to be subbed off (keep brainstorming different elements to track)
* map flow of traffic through a city, make best route through city
