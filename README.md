# ENGG3130_Final_Project
A Case Study in Complex Systems Modelling

Possible Ideas:
* create a model using supervised machine learning to predict whether a soccer player is injured or going to be subbed off (keep brainstorming different elements to track)
* map flow of traffic through a city, make best route through city
*reddit parser that predicts a subreddit or reddit user's preference of soccer team
