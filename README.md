# ENGG3130_Final_Project
A Case Study in Complex Systems Modelling

Possible Ideas:
* create a model using supervised machine learning to predict whether a soccer player is injured or going to be subbed off (keep brainstorming different elements to track)
* map flow of traffic through a city, make best route through city
* reddit parser that predicts a subreddit or reddit user's preference of soccer team


We have decided to persue the reddit parser that can predict a reddit user or subreddit's preference or sentiment towards a soccer team. Initial ideas are that we would identify what team a comment is talking about then determine whether the comment is postive of negative using a Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm. We can use a prebuilt reddit scraper api to get our dataset and use a NLTK tutorial or framework to process the cleaned data.
