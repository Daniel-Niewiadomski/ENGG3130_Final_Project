Things to Research:
* Reddit scapers to get comments.  Or we can just rip a bunch of comment ourselves, or make them.
* Type of machine learning to implement (decision tree, naive bayes classifier)
* What keywords to search for/flag for team guessing

Sentiment Analysis:
* Can be done using Naive Bayes Classifiers
* NLTK is the Natural Language Toolkit and contains NaiveBayesClassifier class
* Lots of data cleaning

Brainstorm of key words to determine Team association:
* Players names
* Team names
* Find team name and then determine whether the comment is positive or negative
